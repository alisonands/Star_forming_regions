# How to read this repo
The contents of this repository include all the files I used in the analysis of my thesis project, which can be read in the file "Andrade_M_field_orientation.pdf". 

Two molecular clouds were analysed inn total, main files related to the analysis can be found in the folders "orion" and "vela_C", for the respective clouds; these give all the final results as presented in the paper. All fits files were analysed in Jupyter notebooks.
